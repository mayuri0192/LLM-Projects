## LLM Projects Repository

This repository contains various projects on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using BERT and its variants. Each project demonstrates different NLP techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Sentiment Analysis, Similarity Embeddings, and Topic Modelling. The projects also include fine-tuning BERT for these specific tasks.
